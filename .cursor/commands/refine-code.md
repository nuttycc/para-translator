Mission: Refine the code for clarity and readability.

Requirements:

- Clear up redundant comments/jsdoc, which may be noisy.
- Refactor the code to make it more readable and maintainable.

Restrictions: 

- NOT destroy the existing logic, which means 'no breaking changes'.
- NOT over-engineer the code, which means 'no unnecessary complexity', or 'no noisy code'.
