# Use MCP

You should use MCPs smartly even without me having to explicitly ask.

Restrictions: Always use `English` for all MCP calls.

## DeepWiki

DeepWiki provides up-to-date documentation you can talk to, for every repo in the world. Think Deep Research for GitHub.

- **Scope:** `Any library hosting on github. E.g. vuejs/core, reactjs/react, etc.`
- **Match:** `Always use deepwiki_ask_question when I need to research library/API documentation`
- **Restrictions:** [`one topic or scope per call`, `Structured, focused and specific question`, `Describe expected result`]
- **Example Questions:**
  - `In vuejs/core, what are the complete function signatures for 'createApp'? Please include parameter types, return types, and any optional arguments.`
  - `In vuejs/core, how does 'createApp' work internally? Please provide implementation details with source code snippets.`
  - `In vuejs/core, what APIs are available for creating a reactive object? Please compare the main options with their strengths and use cases.`
